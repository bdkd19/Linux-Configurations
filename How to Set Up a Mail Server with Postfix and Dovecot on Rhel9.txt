--------------------- How to Set Up a Mail Server with Postfix and Dovecot on RHEL-9/CentOS-9/Rockey Linux -------------------------
Configuration link: https://reintech.io/blog/setup-mail-server-postfix-dovecot-centos9

What is Postfix and Dovecot

Postfix:

Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) that handles email routing and delivery.

Dovecot:

IMAP/POP3 email server that manages email mailboxes and user access.
Together, Postfix and Dovecot provide a complete email server solution, with Postfix responsible for sending/receiving emails, and Dovecot 
managing the email storage and user access.

Postfix (SMTP):

Postfix, as the Mail Transfer Agent, primarily uses port 25 for the standard SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) communication.
It can also use port 587 for submissions, which is the recommended port for submitting emails from email clients.
Additionally, Postfix may use port 465 for secure SMTP connections (SMTP over SSL/TLS).

Dovecot (IMAP/POP3):

Dovecot, as the IMAP and POP3 server, typically uses the following port numbers:
IMAP: Port 143 (unencrypted) or Port 993 (IMAP over SSL/TLS)
POP3: Port 110 (unencrypted) or Port 995 (POP3 over SSL/TLS)



Step 1: Install Postfix

Postfix is a free and open-source mail transfer agent (MTA) that routes and delivers electronic mail. 
To install Postfix, run the following command:

# sudo dnf install -y postfix

Once installed, we need to configure Postfix. Open the main configuration file using your preferred text editor:

sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf

Modify the following parameters to match your domain:

myhostname = mail.example.com
mydomain = example.com
myorigin = $mydomain
inet_interfaces = all
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8
home_mailbox = Maildir/
smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP

After configuring main.cf, enable and start Postfix:

sudo systemctl enable postfix
sudo systemctl start postfix

Step 2: Install Dovecot

Dovecot is an open-source IMAP and POP3 server for Unix-like operating systems. To install Dovecot, execute:

sudo dnf install -y dovecot

Next, configure Dovecot. Open the configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf


Add the following lines to enable IMAP and POP3 protocols:

protocols = imap pop3

Then, configure mail location by editing 10-mail.conf:

sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf

Set the mail location:

mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir


Now configure the authentication process by editing 10-auth.conf:

sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf


Uncomment and set the following:

disable_plaintext_auth = no
auth_mechanisms = plain login


Finally, start and enable Dovecot:

sudo systemctl enable dovecot
sudo systemctl start dovecot

Step 3: Configure Firewall

Allow the necessary ports through the firewall:

sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=smtp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=pop3 --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=imap --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Step 4: Testing the Setup

Verify that Postfix and Dovecot are running correctly. For Postfix, send a test email:

echo "Test email from Postfix" | mail -s "Test Postfix" your-email@example.com

Step 4: Install sendmail

# yum install sendmail -y
#yum install thunderbird -y    <===== for checking the mails on thunderbird

1. Postfix Pre-Installation Steps

# systemctl status sendmail

# systemctl stop sendmail
# systemctl disable sendmail
or 
# dnf remove sendmail

Firewall/Router Configuration

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=smtp

Installing Postfix on RHEL 9

# dnf install postfix
The dnf tool will download and install postfix and configure a special postfix user in the /etc/ passwd file.

2. Configuring Postfix

The main configuration settings for postfix are located in the /etc/postfix/main.cf file. Many resources on the 
internet provide detailed information on postfix, so this section will focus on the basic options required to get email up and running.
Even though the apt installation set up some basic configuration options, it tends to miss some settings and guess incorrectly for others,
so carefully review the main.cf file.

The key options in the main.cf file are as follows:

myhostname = mta1.domain.com

mydomain = domain.com

myorigin = $mydomain

mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain

inet_interfaces = $myhostname

mynetworks = subnet

The format of myhostname is host.domain.extension. If, for example, your Linux system is named MyLinuxHost and your 
internet domain is MyDomain.com you would set the myhostname option as follows: 

myhostname = mylinuxhost.mydomain.com

The mydomain setting is just the domain part of the above setting. For example: 

mydomain = mydomain.com
myorigin = $mydomain
inet_interfaces = all

mynetworks = 192.168.0.0/24, 127.0.0.0/8
mynetworks = subnet

3. Configuring DNS MX Records

Starting Postfix on a RHEL 9 System

Once the /etc/postfix/main.cf file is configured with the correct settings, it is now time to start up postfix. 
This can be achieved from the command line as follows:

# systemctl start postfix

If postfix was already running, make sure the configuration changes are loaded using the following command:

# systemctl reload postfix

To configure postfix to start automatically at system startup, run the following command:

# systemctl enable postfix

The postfix process should now start up. The best way to verify everything works is to check your mail log.
This is typically in the /var/log/maillog file and should now contain an entry resembling the following output:

As long as no error messages have been logged, you have successfully installed and started postfix and are ready to test the 
postfix configuration.

4. -> Testing Postfix

An easy way to test the postfix configuration is to send email messages between local users on the system. 
To perform a quick test, use the mail tool as follows (where name and mydomain are replaced by the name of a user on
the system and your domain name, respectively):

# mail name@mydomain.com

When prompted, enter a subject for the email message and then enter the message body text. 
To send the email message, press Ctrl-D. For example:

# mail demo@mydomain.com
Subject: Test email message
This is a test message.
EOT

Rerun the mail command, this time as the other user, and verify that the message was sent and received:

$ mail
Heirloom Mail version 12.5 7/5/10. Type ? for help.
"/var/spool/mail/demo": 1 message 1 new
>N  1 root        Mon Mar 25 13:36  18/625   "Test email message"
&

Check the log file (/var/log/maillog) for errors if the message does not appear. Successful mail delivery will appear in the log file as follows:

5. -> Sending Mail via an SMTP Relay Server

Begin by editing the /etc/postfix/main.cf file and configure the myhostname parameter with your domain name: 

myhostname = mydomain.com

Next, create a new file in /etc/postfix named sasl_passwd and add a line containing the mail server host provided by the relay service 
and the user name and password. For example:

[smtp.myprovider.com]:587 neil@mydomain.com:mypassword

Note that port 587 has also been specified in the above entry. Without this setting, postfix will default to using port 25, which is 
blocked by default by most SMTP relay service providers. With the password file created, use the postmap utility to generate the hash
database containing the mail credentials:

# postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

Before proceeding, take some additional steps to secure your postfix credentials:

# chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db
# chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db

Edit the main.cf file once again and add an entry to specify the relay server: 

relayhost = [smtp.myprovider.com]:587

Remaining within the main.cf file, add the following lines to configure the authentication settings for the SMTP server:

smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous

Finally, restart the postfix service:

# systemctl restart postfix

Once the service has restarted, try sending and receiving mail using either the mail tool or your preferred mail client.
