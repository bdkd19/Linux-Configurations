============= Steps to Configure Apache/Tomcat in rhel-9 ==============

Step-1: Installing Java on RHEL 9

[root@node1 ~]# yum install java -y

Once the installation finishes, you can verify the installed Java version on the system using the following command.

[root@node1 ~]# java -version 

openjdk version "11.0.14.1" 2022-02-08 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.14.1+1-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.14.1+1-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)


Step 2: Installing Apache Tomcat on RHEL 9
Once JAVA has been installed on the system, now it’s time to download the latest version of Apache Tomcat

# cd /usr/local
# wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.96/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.96.tar.gz
# tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.96.tar.gz 
# mv apache-tomcat-9.0.96 tomcat9

The Apache Tomcat server is now deployed in the /usr/local/tomcat9 directory, you can verify 
the contents by running the pwd command and list the directory content as well.

[root@node1 local]# ls -l tomcat9/

The following is a description of each of the sub-directories in the installation directory of Apache Tomcat.

 bin – contains the executables.
 conf – contains configuration files.
 lib – stores library files.
 log – stores log files.
 temp – contains temporary files.
 webaaps – stores web application files.

Step 3: 1. Running Apache Tomcat Under Systemd in RHEL 9

To easily manage the Apache Tomcat daemon, you need to run it as a service under systemd (system and service manager). 
The service will run with permissions of a system user called tomcat which you need to create it using useradd command.

[root@node1 local]# useradd -r tomcat

2. Once the tomcat user is created, give it permissions and ownership rights to the Tomcat installation directory and all of its contents 
using the following chown command.

# chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat9
# ls -l /usr/local/tomcat9

3. Next, create a tomcat.service unit file under /etc/systemd/system/ directory using your favorite text editor.

# vi /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service

Copy and paste the following configuration in the tomcat.service file.

[Unit]
Description=Apache Tomcat Server
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=tomcat
Group=tomcat

Environment=CATALINA_PID=/usr/local/tomcat9/temp/tomcat.pid
Environment=CATALINA_HOME=/usr/local/tomcat9
Environment=CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/tomcat9

ExecStart=/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/catalina.sh start
ExecStop=/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/catalina.sh stop

RestartSec=10
Restart=always
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

:wq!

Save the file reload the systemd configuration to apply the recent changes using the following command.

# systemctl daemon-reload

4. Then start the tomcat service, enable it to auto-start at system boot and check the status using the following commands.

# systemctl start tomcat.service
# systemctl enable tomcat.service
# systemctl status tomcat.service


Tomcat uses port 8080 and 8443 for HTTP and HTTPS requests respectively. You can also confirm that the daemon is up and 
listening by checking the HTTP port among all listening ports on the system using netstat command.

[root@node1 local]# systemctl start tomcat.service 
[root@node1 local]# systemctl enable tomcat.service 
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/tomcat.service → /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service.
[root@node1 local]# systemctl status tomcat.service 


If you have the firewalld service running, you must open the ports 8080 and 8443 before accessing the web interface for Tomcat, 
using the firewall-cmd command as shown.

# firewall-cmd  --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
# firewall-cmd  --permanent --add-port=8443/tcp
# firewall-cmd --reload

Step 4: Access Apache Tomcat Web Interface
Now that you have installed, configured and started Tomcat as a service, and allowed requests to the daemon via the firewall,
you can test the installation by trying to accessing the web interface using the URL.

http://localhost:8080
OR
http://SERVER_IP:8080

Tomcat includes a web application called Manager used to deploy a new web application from the uploaded contents of a WAR file, 
deploy a new web application, list the currently deployed web applications, and the sessions that are currently active for those 
web apps, and much more.

It also provides a Host Manager application used to manage (create, delete, etc.) virtual hosts within Tomcat.

Step 5: Enable HTTP Authentication for Tomcat Manager and Host Manager

To ensure restricted access to the Manager and Host Manager apps in a production environment, you need to configure 
basic HTTP authentication in the /usr/local/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml configuration file.

# vi /usr/local/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml

Copy and paste the following configuration within the <tomcat-users> and </tomcat-users> tags as shown in the screenshot.
 This configuration adds the admin-gui and manager-gui roles to a user named “admin” with a password of “tomhost@80”.

<role rolename="admin-gui,manager-gui"/> 
<user username="admin" password="tomhost@80" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui"/>

:wq!
Save the changes in the file and exit.

Step 6: Enable Remote Access to Tomcat Manager and Host Manager

By default, access to the Manager and Host Manager apps is restricted to the localhost, the server on which Tomcat is installed and running. 
But you can enable remote access to a specific IP address or network e.g your LAN.

To enable remote access to the Manager app, open and edit the configuration file /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.24/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml.

# vi /usr/local/tomcat9/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

Then look for the following line.

allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />
change it to this to allow tomcat access from IP address 192.168.56.10.

allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 |192.168.56.10" />
You can also allow tomcat access from the local network 192.168.56.0.

allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 |192.168.56.*" />
or allow tomcat access from any host or network.

allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 |.*" />
Then save the changes in the file and close it.

Next, restart the tomcat service to apply the recent changes.

# systemctl restart tomcat.service

Step 7: Access Tomcat Manager Web Apps
To access the Tomcat Manager web app, you can click on the link as shown in the screenshot or use the URL.

http://localhost:8080/manager
OR
http://SERVER_IP:8080/manager
