=====================Nagios Configuration=====================
Nagios is an open-source monitoring software that allows system administrators to monitor the health and performance of servers, 
applications, and network devices. Nagios provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring the IT infrastructure and can alert 
administrators of potential problems before they become critical.

Nagios is an open-source monitoring system designed for monitoring and alerting on the status of systems, networks, and infrastructure 
in IT environments. It helps administrators keep track of the health of various services, servers, and devices by performing checks 
and providing alerts for any issues like outages or performance degradation. Nagios offers a flexible architecture, allowing users to 
define their monitoring criteria and alerts through plugins, and it provides a web interface for visualization and reporting.

Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

Before we install Nagios, we need to install a few dependencies: Apache web server, PHP, and GCC. You can install these
by running the following command:

# yum groupinstall "development tools" 
# yum install httpd php php-cli gcc unzip wget glibc glibc-common gd gd-devel net-snmp 

Step 2: Create a Nagios User and Group

Nagios requires a user and group to run its processes. To create these, run the following commands:

# useradd nagios 
# groupadd nagcmd 
# usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios 
# usermod -a -G nagcmd apache 

Step 3: Download Nagios Core
To download Nagios Core, we will use the wget command to download the latest version of Nagios Core from the official website.
At the time of writing, the latest version is 4.4.5. Run the following command to download it:

# wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.4.10.tar.gz 

Once the archive has been downloaded, we can extract it using the following command:

# tar -xzf nagios-4.4.10.tar.gz 

Step 4: Compile Nagios Core
To compile Nagios Core, navigate to the extracted directory using the following command:

# cd nagios-4.4.10 

Next, run the following command to compile Nagios Core:

# ./configure --with-command-group=nagios 
# make all 

Step 5: Install Nagios Core
Once the compilation is complete, we can install Nagios Core by running the following commands:

# sudo make install 
# sudo make install-commandmode 
# sudo make install-init 
# sudo make install-config 
# sudo make install-webconf 

Step 6: Install Nagios Plugins

Nagios Plugins are required to extend the functionality of Nagios Core. After installing and configuring core service, 
Download latest nagios-plugins source and install using the following commands.

wget http://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.4.3.tar.gz 
# tar xzf nagios-plugins-2.4.3.tar.gz 
# cd nagios-plugins-2.4.3 

Now compile and install nagios plugins

./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagcmd 
# sudo make 
# sudo make install 

Step 7: Configure Nagios
To configure Nagios, we need to edit the Nagios configuration file. To do this, run the following command:

# vim /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg 
In the configuration file, check for the following line, add them if not available:

# You can specify individual object config files as shown below:
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/timeperiods.cfg
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/templates.cfg

Save and close the file.

Step 8: Set up Authentication

By default, Nagios requires authentication to access the web interface. To set up authentication, 
run the following command to create an admin user:

# htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin 

Step 9: Verify and Start Services
First, verify the Nagios configuration file using the following command.

/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg 

If there is no error found, run the following command to enable and start Nagios service:

# systemctl enable nagios 
# systemctl start nagios 

Next, start the Apache web server using the following command:
# systemctl start httpd 

Step 10: Access the Nagios Web Interface

Finally, you can access the Nagios web interface by navigating to http://your-server-ip-hostname/nagios in your web browser. 
You will be prompted to enter the username and password you created in step 8.

------------------------ Now add client on nagios server -----------------------------------

Q- Add ubuntu based client in nagios 

1. install the NRPE package and the Nagios plugins:

$ sudo apt install nagios-nrpe-server nagios-plugins-basic -y

2. Configure NRPE: The NRPE configuration file is located at /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg. You need to edit this file to allow your Nagios server to connect to the client.

Open the nrpe.cfg file:

$sudo vi /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg

Find the line that starts with allowed_hosts and add your Nagios serverâ€™s IP address. For example:

allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.100
Replace 192.168.1.100 with the IP address of your Nagios server.

3. Start and enable the NRPE service: After editing the configuration, restart the NRPE service to apply the changes:

$ sudo systemctl restart nagios-nrpe-server
$ sudo systemctl enable nagios-nrpe-server

4. Allow NRPE through the firewall (if needed): If you are running a firewall on the Ubuntu machine, you need to allow the NRPE port (default 5666):

$ sudo ufw allow 5666/tcp
$ sudo ufw reload

2. Configure Nagios Server to Monitor the Ubuntu Client
Now that the NRPE client is installed and running on the Ubuntu machine, you need to configure the Nagios server to monitor it.

Add a new host definition to the Nagios configuration. On the Nagios server, navigate to the directory where your Nagios configuration files are stored (typically /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/ or /etc/nagios/).

- Create a new host configuration file for the Ubuntu client. For example, create a file named ubuntu_client.cfg and add the following configuration:

define host {
    use                     linux-server
    host_name               ubuntu-client
    alias                   Ubuntu Client
    address                 192.168.1.200  # IP address of the Ubuntu client
    check_command           check-host-alive
    max_check_attempts      3
    notification_interval   30
    notification_period     24x7
}

- Define services for monitoring. Add a service definition for NRPE to check the status. In the same file (ubuntu_client.cfg), add services to check common system metrics (like CPU, memory, disk, etc.):

define service {
    use                     generic-service
    host_name               ubuntu-client
    service_description     CPU Load
    check_command           check_nrpe!check_cpu
}

define service {
    use                     generic-service
    host_name               ubuntu-client
    service_description     Memory Usage
    check_command           check_nrpe!check_mem
}

define service {
    use                     generic-service
    host_name               ubuntu-client
    service_description     Disk Usage
    check_command           check_nrpe!check_disk
}

- Update the Nagios configuration to include the new file. Make sure Nagios knows about the new configuration by editing the main configuration file (/usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg or /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg) to include the new host file. For example:

$ cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/ubuntu_client.cfg

Restart Nagios: Finally, restart the Nagios service to apply the new configuration:

$ sudo systemctl restart nagios

3. Test the Monitoring
On the Nagios web interface, navigate to the status of your newly added Ubuntu client (ubuntu-client), and check if the services (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) are being monitored correctly.
If you see any issues or errors, review the Nagios and NRPE logs to troubleshoot.
