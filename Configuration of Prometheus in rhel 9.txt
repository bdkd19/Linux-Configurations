============ How to install and configure Prometheus on Linux =================
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool designed to provide monitoring and alerting functionality for cloud-native environments, 
including Kubernetes. It can collect and store metrics as time-series data, recording information with a timestamp. 
It can also collect and record labels, which are optional key-value pairs.
	
Login to Terminal as root, with the below-mentioned command, and then follow the steps to install Prometheus.

sudo su -
#1: Update and install the required dependencies
Step 1: Update the Linux packages:

yum update -y

Step 2: Install Dependency:

yum install wget -y
#2: Download the Prometheus package
Step 1: Download the Prometheus package

Go to the official Prometheus downloads page, and copy the URL of the Linux “tar” file.

Run the following command to download the package. Paste the copied URL after wget in the below command:

wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.42.0/prometheus-2.42.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
#3: Create Prometheus User and modify the permission

Step 1: Add a Prometheus user with no login.

useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prometheus

Step 2: Create Prometheus directories in “/etc” and “/var/lib” locations.

mkdir /etc/prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
Step 3: Change the ownership of the above directories to the Prometheus user we have created in the first step.

chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus

Step 4: Now go to Prometheus downloaded location and extract it.	

tar -xvzf prometheus-2.42.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Step 5: Change the Prometheus Extracted directory name to Prometheus.

mv prometheus-2.42.0.linux-amd64 prometheus

Step 6: Copy the “prometheus” and “promtool” binary from the “prometheus” folder to “/usr/local/bin” location.

cp prometheus/prometheus /usr/local/bin/
cp prometheus/promtool /usr/local/bin/
Step 7: Change the ownership to Prometheus user for the copied binary files.

chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/promtool

Step 8: Copy the “consoles” and “console_libraries” directories from the “prometheus” to the “/etc/prometheus folder”

cp -r prometheus/consoles /etc/prometheus

cp -r prometheus/console_libraries /etc/prometheus

Step 9: Change the ownership to Prometheus user

chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles
chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries

#4: Add and modify Prometheus configuration file.
Step 1: Create the prometheus.yml file under the “/etc/prometheus” location.
vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

Step 2: Add the following configuration to the file.
global:
  scrape_interval: 10s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus_master'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
then, save & exit the file

Step 3: Change the ownership of the file.

chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

#5: Configure Prometheus Systemd service
Step 1: Create a systemd service file for Prometheus to run as System Startup.

vi /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service

Step 2: Add the following content to the file:

[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
--config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
--storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
--web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
--web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

then, save & exit the file

Step 3: Restart the daemon services to load the Prometheus service.

# systemctl daemon-reload

Start 4: Start and enable the Prometheus service to automatically run after reboot:

# systemctl enable --now prometheus

Step 5: To check if the Prometheus service is running, run the following command:

# systemctl status prometheus

#6: Access Prometheus Web Interface
To access the Prometheus go to the browser and use the server IP on port 9090.

http://server_IP:9090 OR http://localhost:9090

Finally, We have successfully performed all steps to install Prometheus on Linux.
