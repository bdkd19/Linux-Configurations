---------- Grafana and Kibana monitoring tools configuration----------

To install Grafana from the RPM repository, complete the following steps:
1. Import the GPG key:
# wget -q -O gpg.key https://rpm.grafana.com/gpg.key
# rpm --import gpg.key

2. Create /etc/yum.repos.d/grafana.repo with the following content:

[grafana]
name=grafana
baseurl=https://rpm.grafana.com
repo_gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.grafana.com/gpg.key
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

3. To install Grafana OSS, run the following command:

# dnf install grafana

4. Copy and paste the RPM package URL and the local RPM package information from the download page into the pattern shown below and 
run the command.

# yum install -y https://dl.grafana.com/enterprise/release/grafana-enterprise-11.3.0+security~01-1.x86_64.rpm

5. Start the Grafana server with systemd
Complete the following steps to start the Grafana server using systemd and verify that it is running.

To start the service, run the following commands:

# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl start grafana-server

6.To verify that the service is running, run the following command:
# systemctl status grafana-server

7. Configure the Grafana server to start at boot using systemd
To configure the Grafana server to start at boot, run the following command:

# systemctl enable grafana-server.service

8. Add port on firewall
# firewall-cmd --add-port=3000/tcp --permanent 
#firewall-cmd --reload 

9. Then goto browser and type 
http://ip_address:3000

---------------------- Kibana Configuration ----------------
Q)- What is kibana?
- Kibana is an open source browser based visualization tool mainly used to analyse large volume of logs in the form of line graph, 
  bar graph, pie charts , heat maps, region maps, coordinate maps, gauge, goals, timelion etc.
- The visualization makes it easy to predict or to see the changes in trends of errors or other significant events of the input source.
- Kibana works in sync with Elasticsearch and Logstash which together forms the so called ELK stack.

Q)- What is ELK Stack?
- ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. ELK is one of the popular log management platform used worldwide for log analysis.
  In the ELK stack, Logstash extracts the logging data or other events from different input sources. It processes the events and later 
  stores them in Elasticsearch.

- Kibana is a visualization tool, which accesses the logs from Elasticsearch and is able to display to the user in the form of line graph, 
bar graph, pie charts etc.

- Logstash is responsible to collect the data from all the remote sources where the logs are filed and pushes the same to Elasticsearch.
- Elasticsearch acts as a database where the data is collected and Kibana uses the data from Elasticsearch to represent the data to the 
  user in the form of bargraphs, pie charts, heat maps
  
- Advantages of Kibana

1. Contains open source browser based visualization tool mainly used to analyse large volume of logs in the form of line graph, 
bar graph, pie charts, heat maps etc.

2. Simple and easy for beginners to understand.

3. Ease of conversion of visualization and dashboard into reports.

4. Canvas visualization help to analyse complex data in an easy way.

5. Timelion visualization in Kibana helps to compare data backwards to understand the performance better.

- Disadvantages of Kibana

1. Adding of plugins to Kibana can be very tedious if there is version mismatch.

2. You tend to face issues when you want to upgrade from older version to a new one.
